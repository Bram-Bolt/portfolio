            <h1>ChatGPT vs Stack Overflow</h1>
            <p>Since the LLM hype is coming to its peak, many (new) programmers ask themselves if they should use Stack
                Overflow or ChatGPT. Here's the short answer: please stick with Stack Overflow.
                .
            </p>
            <p>
                This is especially true for those learning to code. Stack Overflow requires you to actually think about
                your implementation and forces you to write down specific questions. Furthermore, when starting out as a
                programmer, your questions are often “wrong” by themselves. Your plan to solve a bug might be in the
                wrong direction, outdated, or unnecessarily complex. Also, most terminology used by beginners is not
                completely correct. Stack Overflow users will regularly correct you, while LLMs will hallucinate and
                feed your delusions. Finally, Stack Overflow is a skill. The fact that you are able to communicate with
                developers, read texts on different levels, and are able to formulate the right queries will be valuable
                forever. One might argue that prompting is similar to this, but prompting doesn't scale. The fact is
                that AI will fail when your code gets more complex than your standard junior-level
                problems<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>. In those cases, Stack Overflow will be your only option.

            </p>
            <p>This ties into a more general comment. If you want to go fast, use ChatGPT; if you want to do something
                right, ask Stack Overflow. It might be harder to navigate multiple threads, but it is worth it since it
                will be the right solution. As ThePrimeAgen stated in a recent video<sup>[4]</sup>, you might spend more
                time fixing ChatGPT's errors than your own.</p>
            <p>And do not forget, LLMs are outdated by default. That is how training a model works :)</p>
            <p>
            <p><i>edit: there are many other reasons not to use LLMs, that are not mentioned in this post!, e.g., the
                    environment, plagiarism, academic integrity (try citing an LLM and it sources..), etc.</i>
